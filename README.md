# semantle-remake
recreating semantle but as a intro programmer
i'm going to learn how to use vector embedding models and recreate the popular game semantle. Semantle is like wordle, but for semantically similar words. i may or may not build out the ui, even though it would be a cool way to learn front-end, but I want my primary focus with this to be using and training embedding models, and computing how "distant" words are from each other.
